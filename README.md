This repository contains the fourth project of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch">The Odin Project</a>, related to **JavaScript, HTML and CSS**.

By doing this project I have learned to further develop my JavaScript skills in terms of manipulating the DOM and also using flexbox in CSS.

*I would like to improve the design of this project in the future, but for now I see the need to move forward.*
